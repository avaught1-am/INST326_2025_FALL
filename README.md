Files in repository:
"Inst326Project" is the main code of the Pizza Game
"pizza_data.json" is the file that stores the pizza data from the menu. It
    includes all necessary pizza objects such as the sauces, toppings, sizes along
    with their corresponding types
"README.md" is the written documentation of how our project functions


#### Purpose of the Game:

To create a memory style game where it tests whether you can remember the customer's order to make the right pizza within a given time.

#### How to Run the Game:

Because this is a memory game, you need to register what the order is saying so that you can recall it easily in order to create the right pizza for the customers

Here's how it works

##### STEP 1: Ask if the customer would like to take an order

Picture yourself as a pizza worker at a popular pizza store branch. A customer comes to you to ask and ask for an order. 

This question asks if you can accept an order. You can make two choices.

- If you say YES, you will receive an order request from the customer, stating their preferred size and dough, sauce and topping.
- If you say NO, the game formally ends.


##### STEP 2: Memorize what the customer requested for a specific pizza order.
